# config generator
This is the configurator i use to build my vehicle defintions. 

There is a basic shop generator included but please note, this is alpha/beta code that was used in the first version of carwanna. 

See the shop generator for better code if you just need to create recipes for vehicles. 

TODO: Clean up code
